# University Year 2 Programming Projects
## Introduction:
This repo is for storing completed exercises from Strathclyde University's CS251 (Programming 2) Course. The solutions to these tasks have been created using maven to handle dependencies, so any external libraries used in the solution to these exercises (e.g. JUnit, Mockito, etc.) will be libararies available on Maven's public repositories.
